Carves out Hunterphage Equipment from the rest of the mod. Some applicable things are now available in Medieval Tech Level. I did this because I think this content makes a decent transition between medieval and industrial.

Based on BlackMarket420s mod. All art assets and ideas belong to them. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3030775138

I have spent some time trying to rebalance the content of the mod. Any feedback is appreciated.

I included a patch for Medieval Overhaul which makes the earliest firearms available at Medieval tech level, they require MO's gunpowder research.
